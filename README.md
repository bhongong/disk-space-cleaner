# Disk Space Cleaner App

A simple cross-platform disk space cleaner app built using Flutter. This application allows users to select a root folder, search for specific files or folders within it, and delete selected results. It is ideal for cleaning up space by locating and removing unnecessary files and directories, like `node_modules` folders in projects.

## Features

- **Root Folder Selection**: Choose a root directory to begin scanning.
- **Keyword Search**: Search for files or folders by name.
- **Filter by Type**: Choose whether to search for files or folders.
- **Selectable Results**: Select individual items or all results for deletion.
- **Bulk Delete**: Delete all selected files or folders with a single action.

## Built With

- **Flutter** - The UI framework for building cross-platform applications.
- **Provider** - A state management solution used to manage app state.
- **File Picker** - A Flutter package for picking directories.

### Notes on Building for Different Platforms

- **Windows, macOS, and Linux**: Flutter desktop support is currently in stable, but make sure you have the required dependencies for building on each platform.
- **iOS**: Building for iOS requires macOS with Xcode installed. The app must also comply with Appleâ€™s guidelines if you plan to distribute it.
- **Web**: Building for the web requires a modern web server if you wish to host it online. 

This `README.md` provides an overview and should help users install, run, and build your disk space cleaner app on multiple platforms.
